      <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
      <p>Tinitis is a disorder in which a person hears a beep of a certain frequency constantly in one or both ears. Against the popular belief that "it's not that bad," this website tries to show that it's not like that.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>To begin with, a person with tinnitus must put on the headphones and press the "start" button. At that moment, a frequency will begin to sound. Through the bottom bar, you can change the frequency you hear. The moment you stop hearing the sound, you must move the sound bar until you hear it again. The process must be repeated for the other ear.</p>
      <p>At this point, the user without tinnitus will be ready to put on the headphones and will hear someone with tinnitus.
